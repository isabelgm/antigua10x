Born in the U.S. to Guatemalan parents, Francesca tapped into her cultural heritage and launched a sandal company Ix Style (pronounced “eye ex”) in March 2013. She was inspired to start the company when she saw the once beautiful Lake Atitlan in Guatemala that she swam in as a child overrun with blue green algae and a new generation of children drinking the toxic water. Ix is the Mayan word for water. For every pair purchased, Ix Style donates to provide clean drinking water to children. The sandals are handmade by artisans from the lake region that inspired her.">
